# BlockchainDemo
##Decription
The project was designed to tackle the research question How would systems in a peer-to-peer/decentralised infrastructure trust each other? The application uses a hybrid consensus drawing upon strength and weeknesses of other methods. A decentralised network has many implementations from hospitals to self driving cars, in a more traditional business sense a decentralised network could be used to increase efficiency in their operations, used to store and maintain data or even increase security.
